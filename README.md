# Readme

## Hi!

My name is Dmitry Balikhin.

There should be a fancy Readme page. Well, later.

{% hint style="info" %}
Interested in application security and software development?

Stay awhile and listen!
{% endhint %}

I would like to share my experience, expertise, and thoughts here covering the whole Software Development Lyfecycle with an emphasis on Secure Coding.

I'm trying to help software developers to create more secure applications. The most scalable way is to provide a good tool to cover "the most important" security aspects.

My journey so far... 

* [x] Understand something in software development \(15+ years\)
* [x] Understand something in application security \(7+ years\)
* [x] Try to share my knowledge with colleagues
* [x] Think about more scalable ways
* [x] Create an application for secure code review \([https://apsanta.com](https://apsanta.com)\)
* [ ] Create an application for secure code review that provides a real value

In between, there are a lot of interesting topics... I will try to share my lessons learned and other thoughts.
